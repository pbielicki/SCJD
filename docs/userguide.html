<h2>Introduction &amp; Index</h2>
This short document is an User's Guide to the <b><i>Contractors</i></b> application. This 
document describes how to install, start and use this application as well as
how to properly configure each application mode. Currently <b><i>Contractors</i></b>
application supports following modes:
<ul>
<li><b>Standalone</b> (<i>alone</i>) - application can work locally in this mode
which means that no networking is needed and all data are stored in local disk.</li>
<li><b>Network</b> (<i>network</i>) - in this mode application connects to the server
specified in configuration in order to retrieve required data. <i>NOTE:</i>
RMI server must be started prior to the application.</li>
<li><b>Server</b> (<i>server</i>) - in this mode simple GUI with buttons for server
management (<i>Start</i>, <i>Stop</i>) starts.</li>
</ul>

This document is divided into the following sections:

<a name="install"></a><h2>Installation &amp; Running the Application</h2>

In order to start <b><i>Contractors</i></b> application you have to follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Create directory where the application will be working (e.g. <code>C:\Contractors</code>).</li>
<li>Create <code>docs/</code> subdirectory in the previously created directory (e.g 
	<code>C:\Contractors\docs</code>).</li>
<li>Copy following files into previously created directory (<code>C:\Contractors</code>
	in this case):
	<ul>
	<li><code>runme.jar</code> - compiled application archive,</li>
	<li><code>db-2x1.db</code> - Contractors' database,</li>
	<li><code>suncertify.properties</code> - application's configuration,</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Copy the following files into previously created <code>docs</code> directory:
	<ul>
	<li><code>userguide.html</code> - this user's guide HTML file,</li>
	<li><code>img/</code> - <i>copy this directory with all subdirectories</i> 
		- this directory contains images for User's Guide.</li>
	</ul>
<br>

<b>Now application is ready to run.</b>
<br><br>
</li>

<li>Start RMI registry (it is located in your JRE <code>\bin</code> directory - 
<code>rmiregistry.exe</code> file). You are not obliged to start RMI registry - 
<b><i>Contractors</i></b> application will start it automatically in <i>Server Mode.</i></li>
<li>Start <b><i>Contractors</i></b> application in specified mode typing following command:
<br><br>
<code>java -jar runme.jar [&lt;mode&gt;]</code>
<br><br>
If you don't specify application's mode it will automatically start in the <i>Network Mode</i>.
</li>
</ol>

<b><i>Contractors</i></b> application should start up without any problems - if not please investigate 
the <a href="#trouble">Troubleshooting</a> section of this guide.
<br><br>

For more information concerning running RMI applications please refer to RMI tutorial:
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/rmi/">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/rmi/</a>
(especially <i>Compiling and Running the Example</i> section).

<hr>
<a name="navigation"></a><h2>Navigation</h2>

Navigation of <b><i>Contractors</i></b> application was designed to be intuitive and straightforward. While
using it you may encounter two different main windows: Standalone/Network and Server. These two
types are described in details in the following subsections.

<a name="alone"></a><h3>Standalone &amp; Network Modes</h3>

Main window in the Standalone and Network modes looks like this:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/main.png" alt="Main Window"></center>
<br>
It is divided into four main parts (from top left to bottom right):
<ul>
<li><b>Menu</b> - consists of all possible options that application enables in the current mode - see 
<b>Menus and Buttons</b> subsection for details;</li>
<li><b>Filter tree</b> - you can quickly search for required data by selecting appropriate tree leaf;</li>
<li><b>Data table</b> - contractors' data from database are displayed in this widget (regarding applied filter).
This table allows user to sort data against required column - just press column header to sort data
against it - if you press again data will sort in the opposite direction;</li>
<li><b>Buttons</b> - buttons that allow user to manipulate contractors' data.</li>
</ul>

Sorting tree is a kind of "quick-search" for name and location fields. For example,
if you want to display only those contractors who are located in <i>Digitopolis</i> just expand 
LOCATION node and select <i>Digitopolis</i> leaf:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/filter_tree.png" alt="Example of Filter Tree"></center>
<br>

If you want to display only those contractors who are named <i>Moore Power Tool Ya</i> and located in 
<i>Atlantis</i> just expand NAME and LOCATION nodes and select <i>Moore Power Tool Ya</i> leaf,
press <i>Ctrl</i> key and then select <i>Atlantis</i> leaf:

<br><br>
<center><img src="img/filter_tree_ctrl.png" alt="Example of Filter Tree"></center>
<br>

Filter tree is automatically updated after each database operation committed by the user.

main window or select <i>Add New Contractor</i> from <i>Contractor</i> menu or press
<i>Shift + Insert</i> key combination. Dialog window for adding new contractor
will appear at once - see image below:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/contractor_add.png" alt="Contractor's Dialog (Add)"></center>
<br>

You can enter new contractor's data via this window and add it to the database
by pressing <i>OK</i> button. If you encounter any problem please refer to
<b><a href="#trouble">Troubleshooting</a></b> section in this document. If you don't
know what each field in this dialog window means, here is a short description:
<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> - The name of the subcontractor this record relates to.</li>
<li><b>Location</b> - The locality in which this contractor works.</li>
<li><b>Specialties</b> - List of types of work this contractor can perform.</li>
<li><b>Size</b> - Number of staff in organization size.</li>
<li><b>Rate per hour</b> - Charge per hour for the subcontractor.</li>
<li><b>Availability</b> - Indicate if edited contractor is available for booking 
or booked for any customer. If you choose <i>Booked for</i> option you must provide
the id value of the customer who has booked this contractor.</li>
</ul>

If you want to change specialties list press <i>Change</i> button below 
<i>Specialties</i> label - dialog window to change specialties list will appear
at once:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/specialties.png" alt="Contractor's Specialties Dialog"></center>
<br>

If you want to add new specialty select one you want and press <i>Add</i> button.
If you cannot find specialty you want to add in the list just type its name by
yourself and press <i>Add</i> button. If you exceed maximum number of specialties
information dialog with relevant message will appear:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/errors/specialties_list_too_long.png" alt="Specialties list is too long"></center>
<br>
If you want to delete specialty from the list just select it in the list (not in
the combo box) and press <i>Delete</i> button.
<br><br>
When you finish selecting specialties press <i>OK</i> button in order to get back
to contractor's dialog window.

<a name="edit"></a><h4>Editing Contractors</h4>

If you want to edit contractor's data select one you are interested in and press
<i>Edit</i> button in the main window or select <i>Edit Selected Contractor</i>
from <i>Contractor</i> menu. Dialog window for editing contractor's data will
appear immediately - see image below:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/contractor_edit.png" alt="Contractor's Dialog (Edit)"></center>
<br>
Navigation is the same as with adding new contractor. In case of any problem please
refer to <b><a href="#trouble">Troubleshooting</a></b> section in this document. 

<a name="delete"></a><h4>Deleting Contractors</h4>

If you want to delete contractor select one you are interested in and press
<i>Delete</i> button in the main window or select <i>Delete Selected Contractor</i>
from <i>Contractor</i> menu or press <i>Shift + Delete</i> key combination. System
will ask you to confirm deletion and confirmation dialog will appear on the screen:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/options/delete_contractor.png" alt="Contractor Deletion Question"></center>
<br>
In case of any problem please refer to <b><a href="#trouble">Troubleshooting</a></b> 
section in this document. 

<a name="book"></a><h4>Booking/Freeing Contractors</h4>

If you want to book contractor for concrete customer you can do this in two
different ways. One way is to select <i>Booked for</i> option and type ID of 
customer that books contractor while editing contractor's data (see <a href="#edit">Editing 
Contractors</a>). Second way is to press <i>Book</i> button in the main window or 
select <i>Book Selected Contractor</i> from <i>Contractor</i> menu. Dialog window for
booking contractor will appear immediately:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/contractor_book.png" alt="Contractor's Booking Dialog"></center>
<br>

In this window the only thing you can do is typing ID of customer that books selected
contractor. If you press <i>OK</i> button current contractor will be booked for
given owner.
<br><br>
If you want to free contractor you can do this in two different ways. One way is to
select <i>Available</i> option while editing contractor's data (see <a href="#edit">Editing 
Contractors</a>). Second way is to press <i>Free</i> button in the main window or 
select <i>Free Selected Contractor</i> from <i>Contractor</i> menu. If selected contractor
is booked confirmation dialog will appear:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/options/free_contractor.png" alt="Contractor's Filter Dialog"></center>
<br>

If you press <i>Yes</i> selected contractor will be available for booking. If selected
contractor is already available for booking you will see following information:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/errors/contractor_available.png" alt="Contractor's Filter Dialog"></center>
<br>

<a name="search"></a><h4>Searching for Contractors</h4>

In order to display only those contractors that match your criteria press <i>Search</i>
button in the main window or select <i>Search Contractors</i> from <i>Search</i> 
menu or press <i>Ctrl + F</i> key combination. Dialog window for typing desired
criteria will appear at once - see image below:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/contractor_filter.png" alt="Contractor's Filter Dialog"></center>
<br>
If you want for example to display all contractors whose name starts with <i>Company</i>
you have to type <i>Company</i> text in the <i>Name</i> text widget and press <i>Search</i> button.

If you want to display all contractors whose name starts with <i>Company</i>
<b>AND</b> rate per hour less or equal than 25 you have to type <i>Company</i> text
in the <i>Name</i> text widget, select <code>&lt;=</code> from <i>Rate per hour</i> combo box,
type 25 in the <i>Rate per hour</i> spinner widget and press <i>Search</i> button.
<br><br>

If you want to search for contractors whose name and/or location matches exactly
your selection you have to select required name or location in the filter tree in
the main window. If you for example want to search for contractors whose name is
<i>Dogs With Tools</i> you have to select <i>Dogs With Tools</i> in the filter tree
in the main window and press <i>Search</i> button in the main window or select
<i>Search Contractors</i> from the <i>Search</i> menu. Dialog window for typing desired
criteria will appear at once:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/contractor_filter_exact.png" alt="Contractor's Filter Dialog"></center>
<br>

You can then specify additional search criteria just like with ordinary searching
except for that you cannot modify EXACT MATCH fields (name in this case).

<br><br>
As you can see you can define comparison operator on number values you are interested
in. Operator is selectable from combo box and the meaning of each operator is:
<ul>
<li><b>&nbsp;&gt;</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- greater than X;</li>
<li><b>&gt;=</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;- greater than or equal to X;</li>
<li><b>&nbsp;=</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- equal to X;</li>
<li><b>&lt;=</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;- less that or equal to X;</li>
<li><b>&nbsp;&lt;</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- less than X</li>
</ul>
where X is a number user types in the spinner widget.
<br><br>
If you want to display all contractors that specializes in concrete jobs (specialties)
- e.g. <i>Carpets</i> - you have to press <i>Change</i> button - dialog window
with specialties will appear immediately (see image below). 
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/specialties.png" alt="Specialties Filter"></center>
<br>
This is the same window as with adding and editing contractor's data.

<a name="exit"></a><h4>Exiting Application</h4>

If you want to close the application you have to perform one of the following actions:
<ul>
<li>press <i>Exit</i> button in the main window;</li>
<li>select <i>Exit</i> option from <i>File</i> menu;</li>
<li>press <code>X</code> button in the upper-right corner of the main window;</li>
<li>press <i>Alt + F4</i> key combination.</li>
</ul>
If you perform one of these operations the confirmation dialog will appear at once
(see image below) and ask you if you really want to exit the application.
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/options/application_exit.png" alt="Application Exit Question"></center>
<br>
Application will close immediately if you choose <i>Yes</i> option and will return
to the main window if you choose <i>No</i> option.

<a name="server"></a><h3>Server Mode</h3>

Main window in <i>Server</i> mode looks completely different than in <i>Standalone</i>
and <i>Network</i> modes:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/server.png" alt="Server Window"></center>
<br>

<a name="menus_server"></a><h4>Menus</h4>

All menus are almost the same as in <i>Standalone</i> and <i>Network</i> modes
(see <a href="#menus">Menus in Standalone and Network modes</a>) except for:
<br><br>

<b>Configuration:</b>
<ul>
<li>Server Mode - opens server mode configuration dialog.</li>
</ul>

<b>Server:</b>
<ul>
<li>Start Server - starts contractors RMI service.</li>

See <a href="#exit">Exiting Standalone &amp; Network Application</a>.

<br><br>
<a href="#top"><i>Return to top</i></a>
<hr>
<a name="config"></a><h2>Configuration</h2>

Although each application mode is configured in different dialog window, they are
very similar and very easy to use. Each single configuration dialog is available 
from <i>Configuration</i> menu only from application running in concrete mode. 
It means that if you are running <b><i>Contractors</i></b> application in <i>standalone</i>
mode you can only change configuration for this mode (configuration for <i>network</i>
and <i>server</i> modes are unavailable).
<br><br>

<i><b>IMPORTANT:</b></i> Please note that all changes in configuration will take effect
only after you restart application. It means that if you change for example database
file in <i>standalone</i> mode and commit these changes you will have to close the
application and start it again in order to operate on changed database file. If
you do not restart application after committing changes it will be using previous
settings.

<a name="config_alone"></a><h3>Standalone Mode</h3>

You can change configuration for this mode only when you are running <b><i>Contractors</i></b>
application in <i>standalone</i> mode. You can open configuration dialog by selecting
<i>Standalone Mode</i> from <i>Configuration</i> menu. When you do this configuration
dialog for <i>standalone</i> mode will appear immediately:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/configuration/standalone.png" alt="Standalone Configuration"></center>
<br>

In this mode you can only change database file on which application operates. You
can change path to database file by pressing <i>Change</i> button. When you do this
database file choosing dialog will open:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/configuration/select_file.png" alt="Selecting Database File"></center>
<br>

In this window you can choose path to the database file and when you are ready
simply press <i>Select</i>. New path will be set in configuration dialog - if you
want to commit this operation and change configuration press <i>OK</i> button.
<br><br>

<i>NOTE:</i> file filter in file choosing dialog is set to <code>*.db</code> by
default. If you want to choose file with any other extension choose <i>All files</i>
from <i>Files of Type</i> combo box.
<br><br>
If you encounter any problems please refer to <a href="#trouble">Troubleshooting</a> 
section in this document.

<a name="config_network"></a><h3>Network Mode</h3>

You can change configuration for this mode only when you are running <b><i>Contractors</i></b>
application in <i>network</i> mode. You can open configuration dialog by selecting
<i>Network Mode</i> from <i>Configuration</i> menu. When you do this configuration
dialog for <i>network</i> mode will appear immediately:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/configuration/network.png" alt="Network Configuration"></center>
<br>
In this mode you can change RMI service host and port and RMI service name where
service host and port are the host and port on which RMI registry waits for
client's requests (contractors service is accessible through this registry).
<br><br>

You can change RMI service host and port by typing it directly into <i>Service Host</i>
text field. Please note that host can be hostname like <code>suncertify.sun.com</code>
or IP address line <code>217.128.81.23</code>. If you want to specify the port 
manually just add colon (<code>:</code>) and type port afterwards e.g. 
<code>suncertify.sun.com:911</code> (by default, the registry runs on port <code>1099</code>
so if you do not specify the port manually this port will be used to connect
RMI registry).
<br><br>

You can change RMI service name by typing its name directly into <i>Service Name</i>
text field. RMI service name is the name with which contractors service (providing
contractors data) was registered in the RMI registry.
<br><br>

If you want to commit operation and change configuration for this mode press
<i>OK</i> button or <i>Cancel</i> otherwise (if you want to discard changes).

<a name="trouble"></a><h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

You can encounter a number of different issues while using <i><b>Contractors</b></i>
application. This section tries to catalogue and present the most common problems.

<a name="could_not_edit"></a><h4>Could not edit selected contractor:</h4>

If you see such error dialog:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/errors/dialog_init.png" alt="Contractor's Dialog Initialization Error"></center>
<br>
it means that contractor's record you want to edit no longer exists in database.
This situation may occur when two different users tries to operate on the same
contractor's record - one of them removes record from database and the second one
tries to edit its data. Application always checks if record that user wants to edit
exists in database before it opens the window to edit this record.

<a name="could_not_store"></a><h4>Could not store contractor's data into database:</h4>

If you see such warning dialog:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/errors/duplicate.png" alt="Duplicate Object Error"></center>
<br>
it means that you are trying to add to database (or edit existing one) contractor 
with data that are already there. Please remember that there could not exist two 
different contractors with the same name and location in the database (this is a
<i>PRIMARY KEY</i> of contractor: <i><b>name</b></i>, <i><b>location</b></i>). Please 
change the data you want to store in the database (either contractor's name or location)
and press <i>OK</i> in contractor's edit/add window or <i>Cancel</i> if you want to resign
from it.

<a name="could_not_store_changed"></a><h4>Could not store changed contractor's data into database:</h4>

If you see such error dialog:
<br><br>
<center><img src="img/errors/stale.png" alt="Stale Object Error"></center>
